  <h2><a href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/" target="_blank" title="The selfish Gene">The selfish Gene</a></h2>
 <p>Our genes made us. We animals exist for their preservation and are nothing more than their
throwaway survival machines. The world of the selfish gene is one of savage competition, ruthless
exploitation, and deceit. But what of the acts of apparent altruism found in nature-the bees who
commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, or the birds who risk their lives to warn the flock
of an approaching hawk? Do they contravene the fundamental law of gene selfishness? By no means:
Dawkins shows that the selfish gene is also the subtle gene. And he holds out the hope that our
species-alone on earth-has the power to rebel against the designs of the selfish gene. This book is a
call to arms.</P>
