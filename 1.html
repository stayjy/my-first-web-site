 <p>Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology, and economics, and
 incorporating full-color illustrations throughout the text, he explores how the
 currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants
 around us, and <strong>even our <u>personalities.</u></strong></p>

<p style="margin-top:30px;">Starting from this provocative idea,
 Sapiens goes on to retell the history of our species from a completely fresh
 perspective. It explains that money is the most pluralistic system of mutual
 trust ever devised; that capitalism is the most successful religion ever
 invented; that the treatment of animals in modern agriculture is probably the
 worst crime in history; and that even though we are far more powerful than our
 ancient ancestors, we aren't much happier.</P>
